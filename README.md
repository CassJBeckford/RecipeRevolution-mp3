## Deployment

### Heroku

This project is deployed using Heroku. To deploy to Heroku, follow these steps:

1. In GitPod CLI in the root directoy of the project, run: `pip3 free --local > requirements.txt` to create a `requirements.txt` file.
2. In the Gitpod project's root directory, create a new file called Procfile. Open the Procfile, and inside this, check that `web: python3 run.py` has been added or whatever the name of your application happens to be. Remove the blank line at the bottom of the file if that has been created.
3. Login to Heroku, select 'Create new app', add the desired name for your app and choose your closest region, note all names must be unique.
4. Navigate to the Deploy tab on Heroku dashboard and select Github. Search for your repository and when found, click 'connect'.
5. Navigate to the settings tab, click 'reveal config vars' and input the the following:

Key | Value
----|------
DATABASE_URL | ** see below
IP | 0.0.0.0
PORT | 5000
SECTRET_KEY | a_secret_key

** either use your pre configured database url, or provision a postgreSQL database in heroku from the project menu this value will then be pre-populated

6. Return to the Deploy tab and select 'enable automatic deploys'
7. Click 'deploy branch'
8. Click 'Open app' after the build is completed

### Forking the GitHub Repository

By forking the GitHub Repository we make a copy of the original repository on our GitHub account to view and/or make changes without affecting the original repository by using the following steps...

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/CassJBeckford/RecipeRevolution-mp3)
2. At the top of the Repository (not top of page) just above the "Settings" Button on the menu, locate the "Fork" Button.
3. You should now have a copy of the original repository in your GitHub account.

### Making a Local Clone

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/CassJBeckford/RecipeRevolution-mp3)
2. Under the repository name, click "Clone or download".
3. To clone the repository using HTTPS, under "Clone with HTTPS", copy the link.
4. Open Git Bash
5. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.
6. Type `git clone`, and then paste the URL you copied in Step 3.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
```

7. Press Enter. Your local clone will be created.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
